After subscribing to workshop, download this:

and then install.

now you will go to your windows default document folder.
and find the arma 3 folder
now go to saved
then go to "steamMPMission"
and now find the mission folder:
"Liberation%20ww2%20Pacific.prei_khmaoch_luong"

UnPbo the mission pbo
and then copy and paste the other mission folder at a workspace of your preference.

NOW is the best part
the part where comes the scripting.

unleash your creativity learning how Liberation works.

Another way to do it, is finding my github version. and downloading it to a workspace of your preference. and changing the "zeus_synchro.sqf". To find it press at your mission folder ctrl+F, and type the "zeus_synchro.sqf"

There you'll make everything that is -1e8 to 0.

NOW you go to the "mission.sqm" and find this:

"property="ModuleCurator_F_Addons";"

under these lines change the scalar from 0 to 3.

another way is going to the the arma 3 default 3den misions folder. and pasting the mission folder there. and open in editor select the zeus module and change the parameters from the none to all mods including unofficial ones.

that's it. further more to know I must learn. 
play fair, have fun. Don't mind my grammar mistakes.
